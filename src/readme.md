## This tool automatically re-names all pdfs in a set of folders to their title, as extracted from the content of the PDF

Purpose: Allow to more easily move downloaded PDFs to suitable folders without having to open each one to see what it is about. Currently vast maj of downloaded PDFs have a title unrelated to their subject matter, e.g. such as their DOI.
